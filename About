Basically this is a $300 drone controlled by an adnroid app connected via wifi and  tcp/ip protocol.
The drone has 3 main units hardware, firmware and the mobile app.As for hardware rotors are conected to escs (Electronic Speed Controllers), the esc's are connected to an esp8266 micro controller via pmw pins
that send analog signals to the escs to allow voltages to rotors.Bearing in mind it is a quadcopter we have a 4 escs 
all draining our lipo battery through it has a high discarge rate, we have a fiberglass pcb with copper linings
to provide a pdb(Power distribution board) for our escs.In addition to hardware we have an mpu6050 6 degrees of
freedom to measure both linear acceleration an orientation to provide an automated flight stabilization method.

For the firmware it is uploaded as a sketch to our micro controller via serial com from my laptop. C and C++ code 
is used to program the EEPROM .Code is all written from scratch made user friendly,mobile and upgradable.The android app is written in Java using http methods to send post requests to our micro controller to control rpms of rotors by
the arduino Servo lib.
